# Introduction
- GreenStore is a concept website that I created a long time ago to simulate an e-commerce website where you shop your groceries. This store does not phisically exist and there's no actual possibility to buy or return products.
- Unfortunately when this project started I didn't have any code-time extension enabled, but I can guarantee it took me many hours to make.

 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
